# High-Mood : Backend (/analysis) 

In this repo the (test) versions of scripts and parsers are developed. The parsers are used to parse the data from a research 
project on the University of Utrecht [link](http://www2.projects.science.uu.nl/memotion/emotifydata/). The scripts include
the song recommendation scripts and multiple mood analysis scripts (some more succesfull then others). Furthermore the 
folder includes the data set used for training purposes.
